# UnitOutlineGenerator
A unit ouline generator for ACT teachers to replace the current ACS system
This is an assignment form Dickson College, ACT, which was to make a more user friendly version of the software that is used by teachers in the ACT to make their unit outlines. 
This was made in ASP.NET using Visual Studio building to Firefox.
