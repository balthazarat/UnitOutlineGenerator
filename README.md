# UnitOutlineGenerator
A unit ouline generator for ACT teachers to replace the current ACS system
This is an assignment form Dickson College, ACT, which was to make a more user friendly version of the software that is used by teachers in the ACT to make their unit outlines. 
This was made using the ASP.NET framework in Visual Studio, building into Firefox.

some of the file directories to get the data from the .csv files to the TSQL tables will need to be adjusted based on where you are storing the files on your computer
